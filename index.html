<p> Welcome! Mythos Scientific is an AI/ALife research company. We are focused on creating "living" artificial neural networks &mdash; neural networks that display properties like growth, self-organization, self-replication, and evolution. We focus on these properties in order to create more adaptable, more efficient and more <i> interesting </i> systems. If you are interested in these ideas or in their use, please reach out to meet@mythos.science. </p>
